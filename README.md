# random_food
The dataset used in work is from Kaggle.com. It has 11 columns with 355 rows. The Food column contains the name of the food item. The category column has 12 unique values where all the foods belong. The Category and food columns are key features of the data set those aid in solving the problem. The project employs Python programming language to clean the data and write a function that acts as the implementation of business logic or the real solution to the problem. Python has a graphical user interface that makes it easy for the users to interact effectively with the application without interfering with the underlying logic of the app. The project illustrates data and code literacy core competencies, such as credible and reliable datasets, data cleaning, and writing procedures and codes to perform data-driven decisions.

<br/>
On CMD run, "pip install pyinstaller"
<br/>
**Step 5: Create a new folder on the desktop. **

**Step 6: Put food.csv and random_food.py in the folder you created in step 5.**
<br/>
**Step 7: Change the directory on the CMD to the folder you created in step 5.<br/>**
Use the dir command in the CMD to confirm if the available files are food.csv and random_food.py.
<br/>
**Step 8: Run "pyinstaller --onefile random_food.py" on the CMD**
<br/>
**Step 9: Confirm that step 8 is successful by ending with a message of successful built.**
<br/>
**Step 10**: Go to the folder created in step 5, copy the food.csv file and paste it into the dist folder located in the same folder you created in step 5. Then open the dist folder and double-click the random_food.exe application 
<br/>
**Observation**
After following the steps above, you will see a window with a dropdown menu.<br/> Clicking the "OK" button will display another window with randomly generated food.
